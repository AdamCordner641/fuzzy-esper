          <div class="column justify plr">Brougham Castle is a medieval building located south-east of Penrith, Cumbria. It was founded by Robert I de Vieuxpont in the early 13th century. Originally, the castle  simply consisted of a stone keep, with an enclosure protected by an earthen bank and a wooden palisade. When the castle was originally constructed, Robert de Vieuxpont was one of the only lords in the area who had loyalties to King John. <br>

          At the time, the Vieuxponts were quite a powerful land-owning family in North West England, who also owned the castles of Appleby and Brough. In 1264, Robert de Vieuxpont's grandson, also named Robert, was declared a traitor, and his property was confiscated by Henry III. Brougham Castle and the other estates were eventually returned to the Vieuxpont family, and stayed in their possession, until 1269, when the estates passed to the Clifford family through marriage. <br> The region was often at risk from the Scots, and in 1388, the castle was captured and sacked. During the year 1388, the castle was seized and ransacked as part of the Wars of Scottish Independence. This event caused the Cliffords to begin spending more time at their other castles to avoid further danger. Brougham Castle descended through many generations of the Clifford family, intermittently serving as a residence. However, by 1592, the castle was in a state of complete disrepair, as its owner at the time, George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland, was spending more of his time in southern England due to his position as the Queen's Champion. For a short time the castle was restored in the early 17th century, to such an extent, that King James I of England even stayed there in the year 1617. </div>
          <div class="column justify plr"> In 1643, Lady Anne Clifford inherited Brougham Castle, as well as many other estates, and she set out to restore them all. After this, the castle was kept in good condition for a brief period, until shortly after Lady Anne's death in 1676. Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet, who had inherited the Clifford estates, including Brougham Castle, sold the furnishings of the estate in 1714. The empty shell was left to decay and fall into disrepair once again, as it was too costly for its owner to maintain. <br> As a ruin of a once great estate, the castle was the inspiration behind a painting by J. M. W. Turner, and was mentioned at the start of William Wordsworth's poem 'The Prelude'. <br>

          Brougham Castle now exists simply as it was when the last main repairs were finished in the 1930s. Brougham castle is currently classified as a Scheduled Monument, meaning it is a nationally important  and historical building and an archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised changes. Before the year 1984, when a survey of the structure was conducted, very little archaeological investigation had been done at Brougham Castle.  In the 1930s, the castle was left to the Ministry of Works and is today maintained by its successor foundation, the English Heritage.
