<meta name="description" content="In a quaint setting by the River Earmont, 2 miles south-east of Penrith, Cumbria, Brougham Castle was founded in the 13th century by Robert I de Vieuxpont. The castle has an interesting history, having been passed down through several families through the ages, even playing a role in The Wars of Scottish Independence. Now open to the public, it has never been a better time to visit this historic landmark." />
