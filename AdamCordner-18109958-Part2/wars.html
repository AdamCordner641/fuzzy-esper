          <div class="column justify plr"> The Wars of Scottish Independence were a series of military battles between Scotland and England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. The First War took place from 1296 to 1328. It began with the English invasion of Scotland in 1296, and ended with the signing of the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton in 1328. The Second War occurred between 1332 and 1357. This war began with the English-supported invasion by Edward Balliol and the "Disinherited" in 1332, and ended in 1357 with the signing of the Treaty of Berwick. These wars were part of a great crisis for the Scottish people and the period became one of the most defining times in their history. After both wars, Scotland was able to retain its status as an independent state. <br>

          <div class="column justify plr"> When the Wars of Scottish Independence broke out in 1296, Brougham Castle became an important military operations base for Robert Clifford, the 1st Baron de Clifford. He began to refortify the castle: the wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger, larger, more impressive stone walls, and a large stone gatehouse was added to the structure. The importance of Brougham Castle and Robert Clifford was so significant that, in 1300, he hosted King Edward I of England at the castle. <br> Unfortunately for the Clifford family, Robert's son, Roger Clifford, was executed as a traitor to the King, in 1322, and the family's estates and various properties fell into the possession of King Edward II of England. The family's properties and estates were returned once King Edward II's son, Edward III, became King of England. The region was very often at risk of attack from the Scots due to the ongoing War of Independence, and in the year 1388, the castle was captured and sacked by Scottish forces.
